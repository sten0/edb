'edbibtex.el' is a collection of functions which should prove useful for
maintaining BibTeX database files using EDB, Michael Ernst's marvelous
Emacs Database.  'edbibtex.el' contains functions for reading, writing,
formatting and validating such files.  You should also have
'BibTeX.dba', an EDB auxiliary file for use with BibTeX style
bibliography files, and a set of sample formats.

   I am indebted to Michael Ernst <mernst@theory.lcs.mit.edu> and
Thorsten Ohl <ohl@physics.harvard.edu> for the inspiration their code
provided and the information they supplied.  I would also like to thank
Alastair Burt <burt@dfki.uni-kl.de>, James Crotinger
<jac@moonshine.llnl.gov> and Martin Maechler
<maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch> for bug reports.

   Please send all bug reports, suggestions for improvement, threats and
praise (if any) to: Michael Burschik <burschik@uni-bonn.de>.

2.1 Comments
============

Many BibTeX files tend to have comments, fancy delimiting lines or
folding information between the entries.  I think the database reading
functions will skip over this stuff unharmed, but they will discard all
such additional information.  In other words:

     Anything which is not recognized as a
        BibTeX entry will be discarded.

   My official position on comments is that they should be put in some
ignored BibTeX field, such as 'ABSTRACT' or 'MY-COMMENT'.  I might write
functions to look for comments in other places, but don't count on it.


File: edbibtex.info,  Node: Strings,  Prev: Comments,  Up: Caveats

2.2 Strings
===========

BibTeX's '@string' command is supported.  Abbreviations will be
displayed enclosed by '#' characters, which should be safe for enough
for TeX as long as the catcodes have not been changed.  The
abbreviations will not, however, be written to the database file that
way.  If abbreviations are entered in database-edit-mode, they must also
be enclosed this way, so that 'edbibtex' will be able to recognize them
(*note Defining Abbreviations::, for details and examples).

3.1 Defining Abbreviations
==========================

'edbibtex' is able to handle BibTeX's '@string' command.  String
declarations are considered to be a valid entry type and are associated
with a separate format file.

   Abbreviations will be displayed enclosed by '#' characters, which
should be safe for enough for TeX as long as the catcodes have not been
changed.  The abbreviations will not, however, be written to the
database file that way.  If abbreviations are entered in
database-edit-mode, they must also be enclosed this way.

   Thus, if your BibTeX database file contains the command

     @string( AMS = "American Mathematical Society" )

   you might use this abbreviation somewhere in your database.  Your
display buffer should then look something like this:

        author:   E.G. Anybody
         title:   Some Remarks on Things
     publisher:   #AMS#

   Make sure you always tag your abbreviations in this way.


File: edbibtex.info,  Node: String Concatenation,  Next: Preambles,  Prev: Defining Abbreviations,  Up: Features

3.2 String Concatenation
========================

'edbibtex' supports BibTeX's string concatenation feature.  This means
that you can write things like this:

     @string( AMS = "American Mathematical Society" )

     @book{Ore,
       author = "Oystein Ore",
       title = "Theory of Graphs",
       series = AMS # " Colloquium Publications"
       ... }

   In your data display buffer, 'edbibtex' will display this as:

       series: #AMS# Colloquium Publications

   You can use any amount of concatenation.

3.3 Preambles
=============

BibTeX's @preamble feature, which allows you to define new macros for
your bibliography, is also supported by 'edbibtex'.  @preamble entries
have their own display format.


File: edbibtex.info,  Node: Validation,  Prev: Preambles,  Up: Features

3.4 Validation
==============

All entries are checked both for undefined abbreviations and for
violations of the BibTeX entry type requirements.  This is done
automatically when the database file is read and whenever a record is
modified.  It can also be done interactively with the function
'BibTeX-validate-entry', which is bound to 'C-c C-v' by default.

   If you validate a string record, then 'BibTeX-string-alist' is
updated.  Your new abbreviation is now defined and will no longer cause
warnings.


File: edbibtex.info,  Node: Installation,  Next: Customization,  Prev: Features,  Up: Top

4 Installation
**************

'edbibtex' consists of the following files:

  1. The main code file: 'edbibtex.el'

  2. A byte compile script: 'compile.el'

  3. An EDB auxiliary file: 'bibtex.dba'

  4. Format files: 'article.fmt', 'bibtex.fmt', 'book.fmt',
     'booklet.fmt', 'inbook.fmt', 'incollection.fmt',
     'inproceedings.fmt', 'manual.fmt', 'mastersthesis.fmt', 'misc.fmt',
     'phdthesis.fmt', 'preamble.fmt', 'proceedings.fmt', 'string.fmt',
     'techreport.fmt', 'unpublished.fmt'

  5. Documentation: 'edbibtex.texinfo'

  6. A makefile: 'Makefile'

   Edit 'Makefile', then type 'make all' and 'make install'.

   If you haven't got make, byte-compile 'edbibtex.el' and put it
somewhere in your load path.  You can do this by either loading
'compile.el' or by loading 'edbibtex.el' before byte-compiling
'edbibtex.el'.  Make a copy of 'bibtex.dba', change its name to fit the
name of your BibTeX database and put it somewhere it will be found by
EDB. If, for example, your database is called 'PhD-Thesis.bibliography',
then rename the copy of 'BibTeX.dba' to 'PhD-Thesis.dba'.

   Put the format files somewhere in EDB's 'db-format-file-path'.  It is
also a good idea to have a format file with the same base name as your
database, so that you will not be prompted for a format every time you
load it.  This file should be a generic format file like 'bibtex.fmt'.
Copy this format file and call it 'PhD-Thesis.fmt' or whatever.

   Reading and writing BibTeX database files is complicated and
time-consuming.  If you are thinking of maintaining database files
containing more than two or three hundred records, you should think
about keeping two versions: workday versions for use with EDB (in EDB's
internal layout) and Sunday versions for BibTeX to work with (in
BibTeX's file layout).  You can control the on-disk representation of
your database files with 'db-toggle-internal-file-layout'.

5 Customization
***************

The file 'BibTeX.dba' is used to set a number of per-database variables
that modify the behaviour of 'EDB' and 'edbibtex'.  Before you do
anything else, make sure that you have a copy of 'bibtex.dba' hidden
away in some safe place.  Make a copy of the file and rename it so that
it will fit your database file (e.g., 'PhD-Thesis.dba') and customize
that copy only.

   A number of constants and variables that should be database
independent are defined in 'edbibtex.el' itself.

* Menu:

* Entry Types::			Valid BibTeX entry types.
* Fields::			Valid BibTeX field names.
* Abbreviations::		Pre-defined abbreviations.
* Multiple Formats::		Using entry type dependent formats.


File: edbibtex.info,  Node: Entry Types,  Next: Fields,  Up: Customization

5.1 Entry Types
===============

'BibTeX-entry-type-alist' is an association list containing all valid
BibTeX entry types and the format files associated with them.  You
shouldn't want to change the entry types, but you might want to give
other names to your format files.

   Note that the list of valid entry types includes '@string' and
'@preamble' entries.

   'BibTeX-entry-type-alist' is defined in 'edbibtex.el'.


File: edbibtex.info,  Node: Fields,  Next: Abbreviations,  Prev: Entry Types,  Up: Customization

5.2 Fields
==========

'BibTeX-field-alist' is an association list containing all standard
BibTeX entry fields (BibTeX version 0.99a) and a few additional fields
that happened to pop up in my own BibTeX database files or Thorsten
Ohl's example file.  You might want to add a few of your own, depending
on what information you require and what style you are using.

   'BibTeX-field-alist' is defined in 'edbibtex.el'.


File: edbibtex.info,  Node: Abbreviations,  Next: Multiple Formats,  Prev: Fields,  Up: Customization

5.3 Abbreviations
=================

'BibTeX-string-alist' is an association list containing a few standard
abbreviations and their expansions.  You can add whatever you like, or
set it to 'nil'.

   This association list will be updated whenever a string entry is read
from the database file or a newly added string entry is validated (*note
Validation::, for details).

   'BibTeX-string-alist' is defined in 'edbibtex.el'.


File: edbibtex.info,  Node: Multiple Formats,  Prev: Abbreviations,  Up: Customization

5.4 Multiple Formats
====================

If the per-database variable 'BibTeX-multiple-format' is set to 'nil',
then only a generic format will be used to display records.  If
'BibTeX-multiple-format' was set from the auxiliary file, then this
format will be the one defined as 'GENERIC'; otherwise it will be the
format of the record on display when the variable was set.  In any case,
however, you can change the format with 'db-change-format'.

   If 'BibTeX-multiple-format' is set to anything other than 'nil',
'db-change-format' will have no effect at all; the format of an entry
will depend on the format file associated with its entry type.

   If 'BibTeX-use-default-format' is set to something other than 'nil',
then the format of a newly added entry (i.e., an entry without a valid
entry type) will be the default format (i.e., the format of the entry
currently on display).  You can change this format with
'BibTeX-set-format'.  If 'BibTeX-use-default-format' is set to 'nil',
you will be prompted for an appropriate format.
