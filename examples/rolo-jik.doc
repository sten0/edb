The format of the rolodex used by the "rolo" program is as follows:

The first eight lines of each entry in the rolodex contain the name,
work phone, home phone, company, work address, home address, remarks
and modification date of the entry.  The field name for each of those
lines is not included, because they are always the same fields in the
same order.  Then, subsequent lines contain extra fields (I'm not sure
how many extra fields the program actually allows; my EDB database
allows five), in the format "Name: value".  The entry is terminated by
a blank line.

Semicolons in field values are displayed by rolo as newlines, so they
are displayed by my EDB database as newlines as well.

In addition, since I consider the "Birthday" and "Anniversary" fields
to be very important, I've displayed them as main fields in my
database, even though they're extra fields in the rolo program.

One of the things I like most about my database is that it
automatically sets the tab width so that all of the field values are
lined up, even when a long extra field name is created.  Note,
however, that this is limited by the fact that emacs 18.59 has a
maximum tab width (for some unknown reason) of 20.  I've posted to
gnu.emacs.bug, complaining about this and sending a patch to remove
the restriction.
