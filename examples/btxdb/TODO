TODO -- some of the things left to do in the BibTeX DataBase
TODO,v 1.15 1993/05/21 22:30:02 ohl Exp

     * recover from broken entry types more gracefully.

     * Check that the problems with copying among multiple databases
     have really disappeared in EDB 1.15.

     * Fix the bug that makes EDB unusable on other files, after btxdb
     has been loaded.

     * Invoke btxdb:initialize less often.  Currently it's called
     every time a new record is called, because bibtex.fmt is read
     then.

     * Work-around or fix the bug in EDB that breaks `M-x fill-paragraph'.

     * Make the `journal' displaytype better understandable for
     someone who hasn't read the code.  Maybe even make an enumerated
     type.

     * Perform more consistency checks on the data after reading from
     file and after data-entry.

     * Minimal support for @STRING.

     * Test the parser and support a larger subset of the BibTeX
     syntax (though we will probably not support every brain-damaged
     ``feature''). 

     * Maybe move from the completely flat model to something more
     sophisticated. 

     * Provide hooks for the internal file format (speed).
