Subject: Elaborate example of EDB use (Genealogy)
From: Michael A. Patton <MAP@lcs.mit.edu>

I'm releasing my genealogy database front-end for EDB as example code.
I've been using it for a little while now, developing it in parallel
with the main EDB development.  The "external" format is intended for
use with a free program called Geneal (which I'm also working on).  It
has a number of interesting features that other EDB users may find
useful for reference...

 o _Not_ written by Mike Ernst, the convolutions of my brain being
	different, it may offer suggestions on different ways of doing
	things.

 o Very elaborate use of the db-tagged external format (this is what I
	wrote it for :-)

 o Actual database is a network, not strictly a linear list of
	records.  There are fields in the database which are
	"references" to other records (these are also always paired,
	i.e. the target will have a [predictable] pointer back).  In
	the internal form, these fields contain the actual referenced
	record.

 o Several special purpose types, for the above "references", and
	lists thereof.  These also have multiple variant display
	functions, so a reference can show as both the internal record
	number and as some text derived from the referenced record (for
	genealogy, the referenced person's name :-).

 o Special commands to move from record to record via these
	"references", including options to create new records if
	needed and provide the appropriate bidirectional links.

 o Fields which are "computed", i.e. not actually stored in the DB but
	calculated internally from other data when needed and cached
	in the internal form.

 o Variant records (although the handling is still a bit of a kludge).
	The database actually consists of 4 different kinds of records
	which have different fields (the kludge being that the rep is
	a superset of these).  It uses the alternate-format features
	to get different displays with only the relevant fields for
	editing in each record.

 o No documentation :-)


To get a copy, use anonymous FTP to FTP.LCS.MIT.EDU and look in the
directory ~map/genealogy (~map/genealogy.tar.Z is the obvious
compilation thereof), all the files there are related, the main code
is in geneal.el, there are five format (.fmt) files and an example
data file.  You will need EDB version 0.29 for it to run.

I've only done the most rudimentary robustness pass at this, and fixed
bugs I came across while using it to maintain my own genealogy DB.
I'll be happy to hear feedback on it from anyone who wants to.  I'd
especially appreciate cleanup of some of the EDB interface stuff (it's
pretty haphazard since I was writing it as EDB was developing).
