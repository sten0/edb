Every time Database Edit mode is entered, these buffer-local variables are
reset to their default values.  This is good for making sure that something
only happens once each time a record is edited.Unused.  Similar functionality can be arranged through `db-edit-mode-hooks'.1.27defmacrodeflocalvarLike defvar, but defines a buffer-local variable.Unused.  Variables that were declared w/ this form are

This function rearranges the field order, converts fields from one type to
another, adds or removes fields, and so forth.  Note that this does not
create a new database; it destructively changes the format of DATABASE.

FCREATE-SPECS is a list of two-element lists of the form:
  (fieldnames creation-method)
If creation-method would be nil, then fieldname alone
may be used in place of the two-element list.Unused.1.27defundb-tagged-rrfrConverted unique caller to use `db-tagged-read'.1.27defundb-tagged-wrfrConverted unique caller to use `db-tagged-write'.1.27defundefine-displaytype-from-optstringDefine a displaytype named NAME according to OPTSTRING.

Mirrors the value of the modified-p slot of the database.
This has to be a real variable so it can go in mode-line-format.
Set it using `dbc-set-database-modified-p'.Converted to :dbmodp.1.26deflocalvardbc-hide-pnilNon-nil if hiding is in effect, nil otherwise.
Use function `dbc-set-hide-p', which works in either a data display buffer or
a summary buffer and sets the variable's value in both, instead of setting
this directly.
Setting this to nil is cheaper than changing the hide function to the empty
one, since no hide bits are recomputed.
This variable is automatically set by the hiding functions.Converted to :hide-p.1.26deflocalvardbc-indexnilThe index of the record currently being displayed (and of its link), or nil.
Use `dbc-set-index' to set this value unless you know what you are doing.Converted to :index.1.26deflocalvardbc-index-fractionnilA string of the form dbc-index/database-no-of-records.
Variables with numeric values aren't allowed in mode-line-format.
An asterisk (*) precedes dbc-index if the current record is marked.
The fraction is surrounded by square brackets if the current record is
hidden.  This variable should only be set by calling `dbc-set-index'.Converted to :index-fraction.1.26deflocalvardbc-linknilThe link of the record currently being displayed, or nil.Converted callers to use the record directly.1.26deflocalvardbc-wraparound-p'delayValue t, nil, or 'delay determines whether going forward from the last
record (or backward from the first) wraps, is prohibited, or denies on the
first attempt only and then wraps.Converted to :wraparound-p.  (Starting with 1.27, :wraparound-p
was renamed to :wraparound, since it can have three valid values.)1.26deflocalvardbf-after-display-record-hooknilHooks called after a record is displayed.
The hooks are called in the data display buffer.
Call `dbf-displayed-record' to get the just-displayed record.Unused.
Converted unique caller to no longer run the hook.
Face customization et al will probably return later.1.26deflocalvardbf-always-formsnilForms executed every time that the format is selected.
These forms are only executed when a different format is replaced,
not every time that a record is displayed (or even every time that
`db-change-format' is called).
See also `dbf-before-display-record-function'.Converted to :always-forms.1.26deflocalvardbf-change-functionsnilA vector of one function (or nil) per record field (not display field).
The functions take the fieldname and the old and new values as arguments,
and return t if the record should be redisplayed.
Use `dbf-set-change-function' to set the fields of this vector.Converted to :change-functions.1.26deflocalvardbf-default-field-facenilIf non-nil, the face for fields in data display buffers.

One of nil, 'message, 'beep, 'ding, 'error.
'beep and 'ding are identical and also show a message.
Having a variable is overkill, but I don't yet know what the Right Thing is.Dropped customizable handling of move-out-of-field condition.
This may return later.1.26deflocalvardbf-field-prioritiesnilList of field priorities for this database in this data display buffer.
If non-nil, overrides the database's field-priorities slot.Converted to :field-priorities.
No scadenza: Not used in any examples.1.26deflocalvardbf-field-search-defaultsnilVector of defaults for field search.
It is one element longer than the number of fields; the element indexed by
dbf-displayspecs-length is the default for a search over all fields.Converted to :search-defaults.1.26deflocalvardbf-fields-displayednilA vector of one string, the displayed text for that field, per displayspec.Converted to :shown.1.26deflocalvardbf-format-filenilThe format file from which the current format was built.Converted to :format-file.1.26deflocalvardbf-format-file-spec-alistnilAssociation list of file names and format file specifiers.

Use `dbf-set-summary-format' to set it.Converted to :sumfmt.1.26deflocalvardbf-summary-functionnilFunction which inserts summary information for a single record in
the summary buffer; it takes the record as its argument.Converted to :sumfun.1.26deflocalvardbf-summary-recompute-all-pnilT if every record summary in this buffer should be recomputed.Converted callers to use :summaries.1.26deflocalvardbf-summary-show-hidden-records-ptNil if hidden records should be hidden from the summary, t otherwise.Converted to :invisible-hidden-p.1.26deflocalvardbf-this-displayspecnilThe displayspec currently being operated upon, or nil.Converted to :this-ds.1.26deflocalvardbf-this-field-beginning-posnilA position, the beginning of the current field.Converted to :fbeg.1.26deflocalvardbf-this-field-end-marker(make-marker)A mark one character past the end of the current field,
or nil if current field extends to end of buffer.Converted to :fend.1.26deflocalvardbf-this-field-indexnilThe index in `dbf-displayspecs' of the current displayspec, or nil.Converted to :this-fidx.1.26deflocalvardbf-this-recordnilThe record currently displayed and edited.  This is an honest-to-goodness
record whose slots are filled from `:original' if it's modified.
The variable's value should never be set except by `db-copy-r2r'; its slots
may be freely modified, however.  This is only used if `:utkmodp' is t.Converted to :under.1.26deflocalvardbf-this-record-modified-pnilT if the current record has been modified, nil otherwise.
This determines which record is returned by `dbf-displayed-record':
if non-nil, then `dbf-this-record-original' has been copied to `dbf-this-record'.
It's best to use `dbf-set-this-record-modified-p' to set this variable.Converted to :utkmodp.1.26deflocalvardbf-this-record-originalnilThe original of `dbf-this-record'; a pointer to some poor unsuspecting
record that shouldn't be modified until everything has been checked out.
That is, when the user is setting fields, this record remains unchanged
and `dbf-this-record', a copy of the original, is munged instead.Converted to :original.1.26deflocalvardbfs-linesnilThe (constant) number of screen lines occupied by each record summary.
This variable is computed automatically from the summary format.
It has a value in both the summary and data display buffers.Converted to :sum1lines in global hash.1.26deflocalvardbs-data-display-buffernilThe buffer of the format for which this buffer is a summary.Converted to :data-display-buffer.1.26deflocalvardbs-indexnilThe index of the record summary at point.
Used in determining whether the data display buffer and its summary
are in synch.  Don't set this variable directly; use `dbs-set-index'
instead.Converted to :index.1.26deflocalvardbs-index-fractionnilLike `dbc-index-fraction', for the benefit of the mode line.Converted callers to use `dbc-index-fraction'.1.26deflocalvardbs-no-of-recordsnilThe number of records in the database when this summary was made.Converted to :nrecords.1.26deflocalvardbs-pointnilThe beginning of the current record.Converted to :point.1.26deflocalvardbs-recompute-pnilT if some summary information is out of date, nil otherwise.

This is not a nonlocal exit!  It sets a flag which prevents future iterations.
(Actually, it sets variable `db-lmap-link'.)Unused.  Dropped support for breaking out of `maprecords'.1.26defmacrodb-lmap-macroExecute LMAP-BODY for each link in DATABASE, and return nil.
If optional third arg HIDE is non-nil, execute LMAP-BODY only for unhidden links.
If optional fourth arg MESSAGE is non-nil, it should be a format string
containing one numeric (%d) specifier.  That message will be issued every
`db-inform-interval' links.

In the body, variable `db-lmap-link' is bound to the link being operated upon,
and `db-lmap-index' is bound to its index.
The loop may be short-circuited (aborted) by calling `db-lmap-break'.
Speed demons should call this instead of `db-lmap' to avoid a function call
overhead per link.Unused.1.26defmacrodb-vararg-callApply FUNC to NARGS1 (an integer), then (if that fails), to NARGS2
of the ARGS.  -1 means all arguments.  This macro lets you deal with
functions expecting different numbers of arguments in a uniform way.
Since this is a macro, don't supply something of the form (function foo)
as its first argument; just supply foo itself.Unused.1.26defmacrodb-with-pcPC is previous-cons.Dropped separate "killed fields" data structure.1.26defmacrodb-with-pc-and-tiPC is previous-cons; TI is this-item.Dropped separate "killed fields" data structure.1.26defmacrodbf-in-summary-bufferExecute BODY in the summary buffer, if it exists.Converted callers to use `with-current-buffer' or `db-in-buffer'.1.26defmacrodbs-in-data-display-bufferExecute BODY in the data display buffer (which always exists).Converted callers to use `with-current-buffer' or `db-in-buffer'.1.26defstructedb--v1-linkUnused.1.26defsubstdatabase-set-alternative-sepinfoExplicit setter for `alternative-sepinfo' in `edb--v1-monolithic-mess'.Unused.

non-nil, in which case the car is substituted for the cdr and the
substitutions are done in reverse order.

If optional third argument CHECK is non-nil, the user is warned if any of
the substituted-in strings already appears in the buffer; such a situation
would make substitution, then unsubstitution, not yield a result identical
to the original buffer, since all instances of the substituted-in string
will be assumed on the reverse substitution to have been the result of
replacing a substituted-for string.

Return nil if CHECK is nil or there were no ambiguities; otherwise
return a list of replacements creating ambiguity."Incorporated into unique caller.1.24defundb-buryBury the data display and summary buffers.

Example: A well-known example of error-correction is provided by
the ISBN (International Standard Book Number) of published
books. This is a sequence of nine digits a1a2...a9, where each ai
is one of the numbers 0,1,...,9, together with a check digit which
is one of the symbols 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, or X (with X
representing 10). This last digit is included so as to give a
check that the previous 9 digits have been correctly transcribed,
and is calculated as follows.  Form the integer 10a1 + 9a2 + 8a3
+... +2a9 and reduce this modulo 11 to obtain an integer b
between 1 and 11 inclusive. The check digit is obtained by
subtracting b from 11.Incorporated into unique caller.1.24defunstring-is-yn-pUnused.1.24defunstring-or-nil->number-or-nilIncorporated into unique caller.1.24defunstring-to-number-trimThis was to support a bug in Emacs 19.28 whereby

versions, but are sometimes much slower.  For deeply indented fields,
this can result in very slow editing.  We disable some error-checking
and correction (which oughtn't ever be invoked anyway) for fields
indented more than `space-maybe-regexp-limit' characters.

If HIDEP is non-nil, then hidden links are skipped.
If MARKEDP is non-nil, only marked links count.

This shouldn't be used for going to fixed points in the
