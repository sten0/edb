;;; Commentary:

;; This file, deliberately named w/o .el suffix, is not installed.
;; It contains thunk ‘dispatch’ for invocation from the GNUmakefile.
;; Available funcs have names ending in "-1".

;;; Code:

(unless noninteractive
  (error "File not intended for interactive use -- see GNUmakefile"))

(setq vc-handled-backends nil)          ; documented disabling method

  (db-find-file infile)
  (db-toggle-internal-file-layout (string-to-number flag))

  (db-write-database-file outfile))

(defun report-1 (infile outfile control)
