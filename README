Welcome to EDB!
===============

   This directory contains EDB, the Emacs Database.
   EDB was written by Michael Ernst <mernst@theory.lcs.mit.edu>,
   and is being maintained by Thien-Thi Nguyen <ttn@gnuvola.org>.

   EDB homepage: <http://www.gnuvola.org/software/edb/>


Dependencies
============

   GNU make that supports VPATH  -- build/install
   GNU Emacs 22.x or later       -- build/install/run


Installation
============

   To install EDB, unpack the tarball, change into the resulting
   directory (usually named edb-${VERSION}), and issue the three
   commands:

      ./configure
      make
      make check      # optional but recommended
      make install

   This byte-compiles the .el files, and copies .el and .elc files
   to ${sitelisp} and ${sitelisp}/edb, and edb.info to ${infodir},
   creating those directories first if necessary.  Normally, these
   variables have the values:

      ${prefix}       /usr/local
      ${datadir}      ${prefix}/share
      ${sitelisp}     ${datadir}/emacs/site-lisp
      ${infodir}      ${prefix}/info

   To use DIR instead of "/usr/local" for ${prefix} include the
   option ‘--prefix DIR’ to the configure script.  To choose an
   alternate ${sitelisp}, use the option ‘--with-sitelisp=DIR’.
   You can use the ‘--help’ option to see full details.

   For backward-compatibility the normal installation includes some
   function aliases that can be considered "namespace-polluting".
   To arrange to not install these, you can use the configure option
   ‘--disable-badnames’.  With this option, the files db-nosetf.el
   and db-oldnames.el are not installed, and neither are the aliases:

      maprecords
      define-displaytype-from-displayspec
      define-recordfieldtype-from-recordfieldspec
      define-enum-type

   See the manual for new names to use, instead.

   By default, the configure script looks for and uses the first
   "emacs" executable found in a directory named in the PATH env
   var.  To use another Emacs, you can either change PATH, or you
   can specify it by adding ‘EMACS=<executable-filename>’ to the
   configure script invocation, as a command-line argument.  The
   latter approach overrides the PATH search.  For example:

      ./configure EMACS=$HOME/hack/GNU/emacs/src/emacs

   The specified (or found) Emacs is set in the various makefiles.
   You can furthermore (at runtime) select another Emacs to use by
   specifying the ‘EMACS’ variable in the command-line for make.
   For example:

      make check EMACS=$HOME/picky-emacs/src/emacs

   After installation, the unpacked directory can be deleted.


Usage
=====

   To experiment, evaluate in this directory:

      (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "lisp"))
      (require 'database)

   Then you can do Dired in subdirs ‘examples’ and ‘skram’, move
   point to various data and .edb files, and use the command:

      (defun my-dired-edb-interact ()
        (interactive)
        (let ((filename (dired-get-filename)))
          (if (string-match "[.]edb$" filename)
              (edb-interact filename nil)
            (db-find-file filename))))

   Note that file skram/examples-syms.data is not distributed;
   you can create it with the commands:

      cd skram/
      make examples-syms.data

   Full details are in the documentation, highly recommended
   for both end users and programmers.


Reporting Bugs
==============

   If you find a problem with EDB that is not explained in the
   documentation, please send a bug report to <ttn@gnuvola.org>.
   Include EDB version and as concise a test case as possible
   (that reproduces the problem).
